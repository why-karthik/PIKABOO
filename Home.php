    This website and database are being developed based on the company Baby Cry which
sells all the products related to babies and kids. It consists of categories like strollers, toys,
Carriers, Feeding, Sleep, Diapering, Baby Clothes, Playroom, Seasonal, Nursery, and bath
time. Our website provides some basic facilities like having the option to save their favorites,
and we want to include more as we keep working on the project over the semester. We plan
to use our database to be able to store all the information need to pull off this baby
product-based online store. We are also looking to add subscription option to our website as
a facility that would be useful for any parent.

     The high demand for educational toys is expected to drive the sales of baby toys. Parents can easily access popular toy sites and compare products. Many websites offer high discounts during festivals and occasions, which further increases sales. These websites also provide the option to return a damaged or counterfeit product to the seller. Therefore, the adoption of online channels for purchasing baby toys is increasing.
